## Agenda
1. Updates from Franco, Cedrus, and Ruizhe on database schema extraction
2. Progress on Agent A (database selection) 
4. Planning for next steps and experimentation
6. Timeline and goals for next week

---

## Discussion Notes

- Franco spoke with Cedrus and Ruizhe. They will continue working on:
    - Pulling information directly from all databases and creating a customised schema for the agent to use.
    - Essentially building something like tables.json, which is technically out of scope but will be useful for practical application (enabling the system to work with new databases).
- For the rest of the team:
    - Getting the right database doesn't have to be perfect; the agent is often correct on people but sometimes misses in the final section.
    - Focus on developing the second agent: selecting the correct tables. This step is easier once the correct database is chosen.
- Franco will send progress updates and questions to the client (as requested by her). He will share the draft in the WhatsApp group before sending.
- Once the first two agents are working, the final agent should be straightforward.
- Franco encourages everyone to experiment with the first two agents. We will share our approaches, compare results, and decide on the best method.
- The `train_spider.sql` file can be used to test Agent A. It contains:
    - Database name / db id
    - Question

## Next Steps Needed
1. Cedrus and Ruizhe: Continue custom schema extraction pipeline.
2. Rest of team: Work on Agents A (database selection) and B (table selection) within your pairs
3. Thursday - Everyone to share progress and findings; compare approaches for Agent A and B.
4. Franco: Draft and share client update/questions in WhatsApp before sending.
5. By next Thursdyas meeting: Aim for good results with Agent A and B, then meet to discuss ideas, including embedding choices (Ash is experimenting with different embeddings).
