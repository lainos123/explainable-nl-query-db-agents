## Discussion Notes

- Cedrus has completed the web app, and it is working well with Franco's guidance.
- From the client meeting: The client is happy with the progress. She requested that we look into BLEU evaluation and also review the evaluation metric used on the Spider dataset (which is used for the leaderboard).

## Next Steps Needed

- **Franco:** Continue with report writing.
- **Ash:** Investigate using the evaluation metric used in spider, including whether we can label our examples with the 4 levels.
- **Laine:** Touch base with Cedrus to see what he needs; work on making the app function on all devices; ensure agents are working well and add features as needed.
- **Nirma:** Label each test example from agent A (focus on the ~70/350 incorrect answers); determine if they are false negatives and why.
- **Wang:** Reach out to check in.
- **Cedrus:** Keep progressing with current tasks. Delegate to Laine

**Note:** TAKE HOME TEST comes out tomorrow (26th) – due 3rd October.
